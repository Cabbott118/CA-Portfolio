# CA-Portfolio

This site is my **Personal Portfolio**, being a centralized location to **Contact** me, view my **Projects**, and checkout my **Resume**.

Navigation is simple.

The below **Links** will scroll you directly to the selected section:

I've added some additional **Links** to the right. These open my **Github**, **LinkedIn**, and **Resume** respectively, in new windows.
